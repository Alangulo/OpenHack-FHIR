# Challenge05 - Analytics on FHIR Data

## Scenario
Now that you’ve dipped into the data analysis role a bit, let’s go a little deeper down the rabbit hole. We want to take a look at some other possible ways to utilize FHIR data to draw out additional insights. Can we do some basic analysis of the COVID-related observations that lead toward respirators? How many of those with symptoms moved to respirators? How fast did they move from first symptoms to respirator? How long did they stay on respirators?

From a data analytics perspective, it can often be helpful to first structure the data so that is your first task. [Jeff: I’d like to add more story here about the data story we are investigating. I’m open to ideas. One alternative idea was looking for common patient observations in certain geographies.]

Once your data is more “report-ready”, you’ll need to help your users understand the data by visualizing it.

## To complete this challenge successfully, you will perform the following tasks.

* **Convert FHIR data into ndjson** You will use Azure Data Factory for conversion.
* **Process the data into structured format**. You will use Databricks to process and store the data in Azure SQL DB.
* **Vizualize the data for analysis**. You will use PowerQuery to transform and PowerBI for vizualization.

## Before you start

Make sure you have completed the pre-work covered in the previous challenge: [Challenge00 - Pre-requisites: Technical and knowledge requirements for completing the Challenges](../Challenge00-Prerequistes/ReadMe.md).
