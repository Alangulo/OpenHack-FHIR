## Scenario
Now that you’ve dipped into the data analysis role a bit, let’s go a little deeper down the rabbit hole. We want to take a look at some other possible ways to utilize FHIR data to draw out additional insights. Can we do some basic analysis of the COVID-related observations that lead toward respirators? How many of those with symptoms moved to respirators? How fast did they move from first symptoms to respirator? How long did they stay on respirators?

From a data analytics perspective, it can often be helpful to first structure the data so that is your first task. [Jeff: I’d like to add more story here about the data story we are investigating. I’m open to ideas. One alternative idea was looking for common patient observations in certain geographies.]

Once your data is more “report-ready”, you’ll need to help your users understand the data by visualizing it. 

Task: Query and transform FHIR data

Task: Visualize data in Power BI

Exit criteria: Coach verifies you’ve identified common symptoms leading to respirators
