# Challenge 3 - Export and Anonymize FHIR data

#### This chapter shows how to .

Check out the [Challenge 0 - Pre-requisites: Technical and knowledge requirements for completing the Challenges](../Challenge0-Prerequistes/ReadMe.md).

## Scenario
You’ve got the core functionality of your new FHIR-based “hub” all set up! Congratulations!!

Moving data between systems is great, but you’ve yet to provide real BUSINESS value. That changes now as a business unit has come to you with a need to utilize your aggregated data to analyze several COVID-related data points in the hopes of identifying potential outbreaks early.

At this point, the team has an existing system set up for their data experiments so they just need a snapshot export of your FHIR-based data. There are some external consultants that will be assisting with the experiments so privacy is a concern. The business unit feels confident they can accomplish quite a bit with anonymized data (and that makes the privacy team happy).

Task: Export snapshot of data [Jeff: can we query a subset of data – both for speed – and to introduce new query concepts?] Export function exports all resources, we don’t even support filtering resource types yet. Providing details on how to verify will help.

Exit criteria: Coach verifies correct data is exported and that it is de-identified
