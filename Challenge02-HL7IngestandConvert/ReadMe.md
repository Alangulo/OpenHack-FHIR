# Challenge02 - HL7 Ingest and Convert

## Scenario
With Azure API for FHIR up and running with basic EHR synthetic data, you will focus on this challenge of ingesting legacy data that's in a different format into Azure API for FHIR. Most (but of course not all) of your existing healthcare applications use some version of HL7, and you have to ingest those HL7 messages and convert them into FHIR format. By establishing FHIR as a hub of sorts, you’ll be able to aggregate data from these various systems and enable interoperability.

First, you need to ingest HL7 legacy data using secure transfer, place into an Azure Blob storage and create comsumable events on service bus for processing. You’ll validate if this is working by checking for the files loaded into the Azure Blob Storage using Storage Explorer.
Then you will use Logic Apps connector and FHIR Converter to convert those messages into valid FHIR format to load into Azure API for FHIR. You’ll validate if this is working by learning some new query capabilities.

## To complete this challenge successfully, you will perform the following tasks.

* **Ingest HL7v2 sample message** using MLLP secure transfer into Azure Blob Storage.
* **Convert HL7v2 message into FHIR format**. You will create a workflow that performs orderly conversion.
* **Validate data load**. You will validate the data using Postman.

## Before you start

Make sure you have completed the pre-work covered in the previous challenge: [Challenge00 - Pre-requisites: Technical and knowledge requirements for completing the Challenges](../Challenge00-Prerequistes/ReadMe.md).
